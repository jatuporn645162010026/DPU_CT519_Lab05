A green house is a place where plants can grow.
Plants in greenhouses are monitored regularly to make sure they
are getting enough light and water. They also protect plants or
crops   from   a   variety   of   diseases   caused   by   nutritional
deficiencies in the soil. Because the greenhouse effect is a natural
phenomenon, it can be helpful to humans if they utilize it wisely.
Farmers,  on  the  other  hand,  are  unable  to  profit  from  their
crops since they are unable to control the key components that
are  required  for  plant  development  and  productivity.  The
temperature in the greenhouse  should  not go  below  a specific
level, and crop humidity should be kept at a reasonable level. In
addition, the PH of the soil must be determined
